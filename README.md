# scalable watch
have a look [here](https://matthiasmeierkoch.github.io/creativewatch/)

This is the repository for a scalable watch, this was a project of the «code and design» module by Hanna Züllig and my first steps with [p5.js](https://p5js.org)

In my project I created a scalable watch, it starts small and as the day goes by it increases in size.

From the inside to the outside:
1. the first element, the eclipse is for the milliseconds.
2. the second element, the eclipse wich is for the seconds. (Takes 60s to complete the circle)
3. the pointer shows the minutes of the current hour.
4. the first rectangle shows the hour compared to the whole day, which is… 
5. …the last rectangle is the whole day.
